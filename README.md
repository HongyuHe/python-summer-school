Programming in Python
=====================

This repository is used for the course Programming in Python for the Amsterdam Summer School 2018 and 2019.
Part of the course is
based on the course [Python for Text Analysis](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis).

Learning Python
---------------

The course teaches all the core concepts of programming to students using Python 3.
All lectures are interactive lectures where both lecturers and students work
in Python Notebooks.
Students can install Jupyter or install Anaconda which is an IDE that comes with Jupyter.

Content taught in this course:

* Variables
* Operators
* Type affordance
* I/O operations
* Control flow (if/elif/else, for, while)
* Strings
* Lists
* Functions
* Local/global
* Generators

Assignments
-----------

Students will be graded based on 4 graded individual assignments.

All assignments will be graded on the correctness (does the code work?) and the style (does the code look good?).
Assignments will not be posted in this repository but on the Canvas.

Aim
---

After this course, students should have an understanding of the core principles of programming, and be able to write
small programs themselves.

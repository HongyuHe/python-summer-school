Programming in Python
=====================

This repository is used for the course Programming in Python for the Amsterdam Summer School 2018. Part of the course is
based on the course [Python for Text Analysis](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis).

Learning Python
---------------

The course tries to teach as many core concepts of programming to students by using Python 3. Part of the lectures are
interactive lectures where both lecturers and students work in Python Notebooks. A
[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) server is used to provide students with a programming environment
that is accessible from anywhere.

Content taught in this course:

* Variables
* Operators
* Type affordance
* I/O operations
* Control flow (if/elif/else, for, while)
* Strings
* Lists
* Functions
* Local/global
* Generators

Assignments
-----------

Students will be graded based on 2 graded individual assignments and a group project. The first assignment tests all the
content until and including control flow, and the second assignment tests all content.

The group project allows students to program in groups and try to create a larger project than the individual
assignments.

All graded work is grades on correctness (does the code work?) and style (does the code look good?). Assignments will
not be posted in this repository.

Each day will also have a practical session, where students can program and ask questions about the assignments.

Aim
---

After this course, students should have an understanding of the core principles of programming, and be able to write
small programs themselves.

\section{Requirements}
No formal background in programming is necessary. A completed undergraduate course in mathematics
(linear algebra, basic calculus, combinatorics and logic) would help.

You should bring a laptop on which latest version of Anaconda is installed.
This can be downloaded for free https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Make sure that you download the file for Python 3.7 and for your own Operating System.

Without the Anaconda software, you will not be able to follow the class.

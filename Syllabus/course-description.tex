\section{Course Description}
This course is an introductory course to programming.
Python language will be used to demonstrate various programming concepts.
\paragraph{}
From the day 1, we plan to do hands-on exercises. In the first week,
students will be introduced to the software (Anaconda) to be used during the course.
By the end of the first week, students will be comfortable with writing small
programs in Python using the Anaconda.
\paragraph{}
In the second week, we will study some advanced concepts in Python (e.g. generators, decorators)
and some libraries like pandas and scikit. Depending on the background of students, these
libraries might change. For example, if more students have background in Biology and Bioinformatics,
then we will consider using libraries suitable for DNA or protein sequence analysis.
\paragraph{}
By the end of the second week, students should be able to write python programs that
can solve the problems in their chosen field of career.
